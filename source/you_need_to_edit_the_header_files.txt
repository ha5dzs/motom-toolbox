If you got here, you copied the NDI API header files to this directory, and got curious on what is in this file.

If you only want to work with Matlab and you don't want to add these header files to the C compiler's default search path,
you need to edit the header files so the four files:
-ndhost.h
-ndpack.h
-ndtypes.h
-ndopto.h
...will make the compiler look for the file in the same directory.

i.e. change this: #include <header.h> to this: #include "header.h" for all header files in this directory

Also, add the following to the top of ndopto.h:

#include "ndtypes.h"
#include "ndpack.h"
