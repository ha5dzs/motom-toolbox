# You don't need to use these functions

Most of this functionality is implemented in `optotrak_align_my_system()`, so you don't need to use these scripts. They are not even added to the path.  
These scripts are here in case you want to access an individual feature for some reason.

**Want to align quickly and efficiently? Use `optotrak_align_my_system()`!**
## Coordinate system alignment

With the Optotrak system, you can't change the size of a sensor unit. Everything will be measured in millimetres.
These script included in this directory works stand-alone. The one in the path is a function, which returns the alignment tolerance.

`optotrak_regiser_many_cameras_static.m` does not work.
