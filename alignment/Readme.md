## Coordinate system alignment

With the Optotrak system, you can't change the size of a sensor unit. Everything will be measured in millimetres.
These script included in this directory works stand-alone. The one in the path is a function, which returns the alignment tolerance.

**IMPORTANT** `optotrak_regiser_many_cameras_static.m` does not work.
